# Material Duplicator
Just choose the Preferences -> Addons -> Install from file... and select the materialDuplicator.py file. This will add a "Duplicate" tab on the properties panel of the Node editor. This makes a new copy of the current material and handles all references used for drivers inside of the material, making it truly "single user".
